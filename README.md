# frontend-template

## Introduction
Welcome to our technical interview process! 

In this interview, we'd like to assess your skills in creating appealing user interfaces using React, TypeScript, and JavaScript. We expect the exercise to take roughly 2-3 hours.

You'll be asked to submit some code for an application that tackles two specific tasks:
* **Add New and Edit People and Their Friends:** You'll be required to create UIs that allow users to add new or edit people and their friends. The original dataset can be found in _people.json_ in this repo. This task will test your ability to handle form inputs, manage state, and work with data structures.
* **Visualize Data:** You'll also need to create a UI component that visualizes the data in an interesting way. This could involve creating charts, graphs, or any other visualization that provides meaningful insights from the collected data.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
* **Functionality:** Does your code accomplish the tasks specified in a functional manner?
* **Code Quality:** Is your code well-structured, readable, testable, and maintainable? Are best practices followed? 
* **UI/UX:** Is the UI intuitive and visually appealing? Does the data visualization component provide valuable insights? Does the UI take accessibility into account?

## Additional Information
* All of the necessary data for the tasks can be found in _people.json_ in this repo, so you do not need to worry about data generation.
* You are provided with an Express server that will serve up the data via a set of REST APIs
* You are free, within the constraints already mentioned, to use any libraries or tools you prefer to complete the tasks.
* Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or need clarification during the interview process.

We look forward to reviewing your submission and assessing your skills in Front-end development. Good luck with your interview, and we appreciate your interest in joining our team!
